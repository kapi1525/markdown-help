markdown-help is a small tool that creates .chm (microsoft html help) files from markdown files, and overall is easier to use.
You can still use this if you want to use html files it wont touch those, it only converts md files.
Currently supports only [chmcmd compiler from free pascal](https://wiki.freepascal.org/htmlhelp_compiler), i'll add support for microsofts compiler later, after i cleanup this messy code...
